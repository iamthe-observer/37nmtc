          built. It was established during the Second World War to train
          soldiers to augment the expatriate staff strength in the general
          hospital and the Medical Reception Stations (MRS). The college was

          Since the training Wing was the 2nd administrative brancn of the
          hospital, the Sister Tutor acted in the capacity of the OIC and was
          responsible to the CO of the hospital. The OIC had 2iC and other
          tutors under ner tor the various subjects. Some of the names of the
          tutors were Lt. Sintim Aboagye and Sister Hutchinson White, Capt.
          Danso Adams and Capt. Sunkwa Mills. As stipulated by the AFR Adm Vol 1
          , the tutors were on special allowance and other benefits such as
          special coffee break and annual leave outside the country. The general
          office of the college had a WO 1 in charge of the administrative staff
          and he acted as the RSM of the wing. He saw to the general discipline
          and organization of the wing. The RSM of the wing was respected by the
          students and student moral was high. The RSM also checked on the
          regularity of the students tor lectures, since some of the courses
          were taken outside the college. He made regular inspection to the
          student lines and ensured that their feeding and general comfort was
          given. It is also recorded that the college had its own Part One and
          tutors read the hospital night's report The college collected every
          item needed from the Quarter Master yard, yet it had its own financial
          pool where the Sister Tutors had control over.

        <div class="font-Sorts_Mills_Goudy text-left">
          <p>
            After six months of classroom work, students were sent to the ward
            for practical nursing for three months. They then went back to the
            class to complete the year's course. Record indicates that students
            were nowever grouped into two after the BIV course. There was field
            ambulance training course and actual nursing course. From 1961 , the
            students were divided into these groups. The first three students to
            read the basic nursing course were:
          </p>
          <ol class="list-disc ml-4">
            <li>PTE Atsu Anago</li>
            <li>PTE Owusu Binpa</li>
            <li>PTE Owusu Sarpong</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The other group went in for the field ambulance course. The third
            category of nurses were the Brigade nurses. The two brigade nurses
            are:
          </p>
          <ol class="list-disc ml-4">
            <li>Nurse Osei Kwao</li>
            <li>Nurse Osahene</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            These two students were from the workers' brigade and in 1961 were
            posted back to the various brigade centres which were sited in Cape
            Coast, Winneba, Takoradi and Kumasi. However, after the 1966 coup
            de' tat, these nurses were brought back to the Military Hospital and
            they rose through the ranks. Sister Kwao was the Principal Nursing
            Sister at the Accident and Emergency unit before her death in 2004
            While Sister Asanene wno iS a medical assistant (Rtd) is still alive
            but on pension.

            Qualified Registered Nurses (QRN)
          </h2>
          <p>
            As earlier on stated, the college started the QRN course in 1958 and
            trained a lot of soldiers and brigade nurses for both the hospital
            and workers' brigade nospitals. The Ministry of Health pnased out
            the QRN course in 1972. After phasing out the QRN course, ENT, SRN
            and SRM were introduced in the same year 1972.

            The NOTW was first sited at the present No. Reception, now School of

          Training College when the Nursing and Midwifery Council ot Ghana, gave
          the approval for the school to run the State Registered Nursing(SRN)
          Programme, thus making it the fourth professional nursing college in
          Ghana following Korle-Bu, Accra, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital,
          Kumasi and Agogo Presbyterian Hospital. Today, it is called Nursing
          and Midwifery Training College with student population of about 301:
